A mixture density network (MDN) Layer for Keras using TensorFlow's distributions module. This makes it a bit more simple to experiment with neural networks that predict multiple real-valued variables that can take on multiple equally likely values.

This layer can help build MDN-RNNs similar to those used in [RoboJam](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/robojam), [Sketch-RNN](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/sketch-rnn-demo), [handwriting generation](https://distill.pub/2016/handwriting/), and maybe even [world models](https://worldmodels.github.io). You can do a lot of cool stuff with MDNs!

One benefit of this implementation is that you can predict any number of real-values. TensorFlow's `Mixture`, `Categorical`, and `MultivariateNormalDiag` distribution functions are used to generate the loss function (the probability density function of a mixture of multivariate normal distributions with a diagonal covariance matrix). In previous work, the loss function has often been specified by hand which is fine for 1D or 2D prediction, but becomes a bit more annoying after that.

Two important functions are provided for training and prediction:

- `get_mixture_loss_func(output_dim, num_mixtures)`: This function generates a loss function with the correct output dimensiona and number of mixtures.
- `sample_from_output(params, output_dim, num_mixtures, temp=1.0)`: This functions samples from the mixture distribution output by the model.

## Installation 

This project requires Python 3.6+, TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability. You can easily install this package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/keras-mdn-layer/) via `pip` like so:

    python3 -m pip install keras-mdn-layer

And finally, import the module in Python: `import keras_mdn_layer as mdn`

Alternatively, you can clone or download this repository and then install via `python setup.py install`, or copy the `mdn` folder into your own project.

## Build

This project builds using `poetry`. To build a wheel use `poetry build`.

## Examples

Some examples are provided in the notebooks directory.

To run these using `poetry`, run `poetry install` and then open jupyter `poetry run jupyter lab`.

There's scripts for fitting multivalued functions, a standard MDN toy problem:

There's also a script for generating fake kanji characters:

And finally, for learning how to generate musical touch-screen performances with a temporal component:

## How to use

The MDN layer should be the last in your network and you should use `get_mixture_loss_func` to generate a loss function. Here's an example of a simple network with one Dense layer followed by the MDN.

    from tensorflow import keras
    import keras_mdn_layer as mdn

    N_HIDDEN = 15  # number of hidden units in the Dense layer
    N_MIXES = 10  # number of mixture components
    OUTPUT_DIMS = 2  # number of real-values predicted by each mixture component

    model = keras.Sequential()
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(N_HIDDEN, batch_input_shape=(None, 1), activation='relu'))
    model.add(mdn.MDN(OUTPUT_DIMS, N_MIXES))
    model.compile(loss=mdn.get_mixture_loss_func(OUTPUT_DIMS,N_MIXES), optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam())
    model.summary()

Fit as normal:

    history = model.fit(x=x_train, y=y_train)

The predictions from the network are parameters of the mixture models, so you have to apply the `sample_from_output` function to generate samples.

    y_test = model.predict(x_test)
    y_samples = np.apply_along_axis(sample_from_output, 1, y_test, OUTPUT_DIMS, N_MIXES, temp=1.0)

See the notebooks directory for examples in jupyter notebooks!

### Load/Save Model

Saving models is straight forward:

    model.save('test_save.h5')

But loading requires `cutom_objects` to be filled with the MDN layer, and a loss function with the appropriate parameters:

    m_2 = keras.models.load_model('test_save.h5', custom_objects={'MDN': mdn.MDN, 'mdn_loss_func': mdn.get_mixture_loss_func(1, N_MIXES)})
